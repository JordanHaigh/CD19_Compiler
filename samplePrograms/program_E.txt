/-- e) Write a program in CD19 that will compute the area of a polygon from a set of (x, y) Cartesian points.
/-- The program should have functions to (i) input the number of points (up to 20) and the
/-- points themselves, and (ii) compute the area of the polygon.
/-- The main program should be used to output the result.
